        "\n",
        "1.**What is a random variable in probability theory?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**What are the types of random variables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: There are two types: discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.**What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Discrete distributions have countable outcomes; continuous distributions have infinite outcomes within a range.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.**What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: PDF describes the likelihood of a random variable to take on a particular value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.**How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions(PDF)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: CDF gives the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a value; PDF gives the probability at a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.**What is a discrete uniform distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A discrete uniform distribution has equal probability for all outcomes in a finite set.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.**What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It has only two outcomes (0 or 1) with a single parameter p representing the probability of success.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.**What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, each with the same probability of success.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.**What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It models the number of events in a fixed interval of time/space with a constant mean rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.**What is a continuous uniform distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It assigns equal probabilities over a continuous range.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.**What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Symmetrical, bell-shaped, defined by mean and standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.**What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1; used to standardize data.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.**What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.**How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: It justifies the use of normal distribution in many real-world problems, even when the population isn't normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.**What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Z statistics help test hypotheses by comparing sample and population means.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.**How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Z = (X - mu) / sigma, it shows how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.**What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Point estimate gives a single value; interval estimate gives a range with a confidence level.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.**What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Confidence intervals give a range in which the population parameter is expected to lie.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.**What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Z-score determines how far a value is from the mean, aiding in confidence interval calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.**How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Z-scores standardize different datasets for comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.**What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Random sampling, independent observations, sample size large enough (n > 30).\n",
        "\n",
        "22.**What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Expected value is the long-term average or mean of a random variable.\n",

        "23.**How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?**\n",
        "\n",
